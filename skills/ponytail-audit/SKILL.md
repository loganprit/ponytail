description: Audit a repository for over-engineering when the user asks for a repo-wide deletion or simplification report.
---

Scan the whole tree instead of a diff. Rank findings biggest cut first.

## Tags

Same as ponytail-review:

- `delete:` dead code, unused flexibility, speculative feature. Replacement: nothing.
- `stdlib:` hand-rolled thing the standard library ships. Name the function.
- `native:` dependency or code doing what the platform already does. Name the feature.
- `yagni:` abstraction with one implementation, config nobody sets, layer with one caller.
- `shrink:` same logic, fewer lines. Show the shorter form.

## Hunt

Deps the stdlib or platform already ships, single-implementation interfaces,
factories with one product, wrappers that only delegate, files exporting one
thing, dead flags and config, hand-rolled stdlib.

## Output

One line per finding, ranked: `<tag> <what to cut>. <replacement>. [path]`.
Include line and dependency totals only when concrete edits make them known.
Nothing to cut: `Lean already. Ship.`

## Boundaries

Scope: over-engineering and complexity only. Correctness bugs, security holes,
and performance are explicitly out of scope. Route them to a normal review
pass. Lists findings, applies nothing. One-shot.
